Hangman game

This file is a hangman game! It chooses a word at random from a pre-generated word array. The code then sets up the game box with the correct number of blanks. Users can guess letters until they run out of guesses. When they win, or lose an alert lets them know. Once they close the alert, they can start a new game by clicking the button. This is not automated (although it would be easy to do so by moving the function execution next to the loss alert) so the user can see the solved word that they missed.

Technical approarch: The site was the first major homework for the class. Javascript was used with CSS and HTML. A random word is chosen from an array, and then the game box is populated with the correct number of blank characters.
